# GitHub Repository for the INFO 6850 Final Paper
## Models of Judicial Decision-Making in Amicus Networks
Ritik Batra, Evan Dong, Jennah Gosciak, Emma Harvey

Our project frames Supreme Court decisions are outcomes of collective decision-making processes. We propose an algorithm to learn individual thresholdsand apply this algorithm to real-world network data on Supreme Court justices and amicus brief organizations. Please refer to `final.ipynb' for the final jupyter notebook relating to our analysis.

To run the notebook with the same installation setup that we used, you can run the following command to create a new anaconda environment called `amicus`:

```conda env update -n amicus --file amicus.yml```
